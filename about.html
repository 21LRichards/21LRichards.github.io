        <p> Hi! My name is Logan and I am an aspiring coder. I have a background in coding from high school. I have done coding in Java, HTML, CSS, C++, and MIT App Inventor. <br>
    I am hoping to become either a computer programmer, a computer engineer, or a cybersecurity analyst in my future. I played soccer in high school and was undefeated n my final season. <br>
            I also play Xbox in my spare time along with hanging out with friends. <br>
