                <h1> Final Project and How to Play </h1>
                <p> This project was made for CSC 106 in April, 2022. The project is a slot machine which uses a button to "spin" the slots and comes out with three images. <br>
The start screen has two buttons; how to play and start. By pressing the how to play button, the scene changes which calls a function called howtoPlay which has text which tells you how to play the game.<br>
There is then a back button which brings you back to the start screen. You can then press the start button which brings you to the game screen. The game screen has a slot machine with three boxes and a spin button. <br>
By clicking the button the images in the slots will change. If you get two of the same image you receive 30 points added to your score. <br>
If you get all three of the same image, you receive 100 points. Clicking the spin button loses you 10 points just like if you were to put money into a slot machine. <br>
If you reach 0 points you get a Game Over and can no longer spin the slot machine. </p>
